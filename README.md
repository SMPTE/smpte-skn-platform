# smpte-platform-migration

**Migration from HL OLC to Office 365 and other Tools**

This repository was created so that the GitHub Issue Tracker could be used for reporting issues that need to be addressed before the SMPTE Standards Community can move to Microsoft Office 365. This move will allow the SMPTE Standards Community to utilize tools like Teams, Outlook, Sharepoint, Planner, GitHub and others.
