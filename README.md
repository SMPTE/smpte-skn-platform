# SMPTE SKN Platform

**Improving the SMPTE Standards Knowledge Network (SKN)**

The purpose of this repository has some what change after we completed the migration from the SMPTE OLC to the SMPT SKN. This repository will now be used to support the continued improvement of the SMPTE SKN. It is specifically used to track issues with and feature requests for the SKN. We will use the Issue Tracker for this repository to do so.
